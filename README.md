Tic Tac Toe

To play this game, point your browser at the index.html file, or upload it to a directory on your site.

When Player A is ready, they may click any square to begin. The player selection will change automatically.

If a player makes a mistake, click the undo arrow to step back a move. (Or however many you want).

If a 3x3 grid gets boring, you can play with any number of squares by changing the number in the box at the top.



This game was built using jQuery (http://jquery.com/), and HandlebarsJS (http://handlebarsjs.com/)

Enjoy!
